Why did no one once try and get wanda back and out of control of the dark hold. It was never even considered an option.Doctor strange felt no care at all for her. Well that's how I felt it was shown. He cared more about this random new girl.She is a huge avenger and has contributed greatly. She needs more attention of her important role on a personal level in the MCU. Why did no one care about her?I hope she returns. Fantastic character to watch. Unbeatable.", "Better than homecoming by a mile. Would've been so much better if they didn't cut so many scenes. Because you can feel the cuts especially in the second half of the movie. But in general succesful story flow, good acting, a reasonable evil, beautiful cinematography. 8/10 but cause of the general rating is low I'm giving 10/10. I wonder what rating people gave to Spider-Man No Way Home. This one is clearly a better movie.", "If you were hesitant on seeing this movie because of certain stuff you will see in this movie trust me you will regret not seeing it. This movie is amazing it's not everything it could have been but for what it is it's awesome exploring the multiverse was one of the coolest sequences I have ever seen. Sam rami knocked it out of the park with him being back in the director's chair.", "This movie is better than spider-man no way home, I just want to say that if u r goint to watch this movie, u should not get ur expectations high.... And it will become ur most favourite movie, some people might get offend with my opinion, but it has a better story than spider-man no way home. Fans loved spiderman no way home because of its cameos....(spider-man no way home was a fan service movie) and the same people will get disappointed because of their expectations ....trust me after watching this movie if u get disappointed it's ur mistake not Marvel's mistake.... Thats why I don't trust on any rumours and u people should do the same go with empty mind and come with ur amazing experience....if spiderman no way home is 10/10 than doctor strange in the multiverse of madness is 9.9/10, Marvel didn't said that they are doing any cameos ...it was ur mistake that u trusted rumours and took ur expectations to the moon...anyway best marvel movie according to me.", "Going into this film I expected a lot, and a lot of the things I was expecting didn't happen. This film is definitely different from any other marvel film released and it gives vibes of it being divisive, which I think is kind of a good thing. This movie is messy and chopped with many different things happening all at once, But it tells a satisfying story with such an incredible villain! Wanda Maximoff as the scarlet witch absolutely knocked it out of the park and her villainess role is what gave the movie its strength! I literally cried when she realized that she was scaring Tommy and Billy in that other universe! The other thing I really liked about this film was the jump scares and the horror elements. I literally got scared for those quick seconds! I really wish though that we could've seen more recalls or more connections to WandaVision as well as maybe some plot holes that would be addressed from the show in this movie but we didn't get that. The film also felt like it needed to be longer than just two hours and six minutes. And I was worried about the runtime since it was revealed. It felt completely rushed in the sense of action but also in trying to tell a mind bending story about the multiverse. And it didn't even feel like the multiverse was incredibly explored fully. But the other great parts are the other leads, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rachel McAdams and Xochitl Gomez! This movie looks like it could benefit from another version with more fight sequences like with Professor X and Wanda. Like if they were fighting a little bit before while they were in the air or something, that would be incredible to see. And maybe some more cameos could would be revealed. But I highly recommend this film even if you're confused and if there's little plot holes. This isn't the worst MCU film but it's technically not the best which makes it fascinating to me!", "Arhhhhhh!!! I love it!!!!! Oh My Sweet Child!!! The plot is awesome!!! And the character!!!! And let's not forget the actors and actresses!!!!!! Jesus! They choose one hot character!!!!!! It's so good!!! And the effects are WOW!!!!!!! But it's just that Benedict Cumberbatch when he is being a zombie you could see the make up! But not really a big deal. I would love to see it again soon!!!!!", "Seriously getting sick of people leaving negative reviews about really good movies. Let's start with this. ITS NOT REAL. Why cant people just take movies for what they are. A made up movie. It's not a true life story a documentary. It's from a comic book. It's very entertaining and a very good movie. End of. Whoever watched this obviously didn't watch it at all. Cause to say strange isn't in this movie is a joke.", 'A really good movie. Wanda with Dr. Strange was a really good combination for a movie . I really hope Wanda is not dead . She really deserves her own movie from marvel .', "It was absolutely amazing, of course there's people complaining about not enough multiverse and I understand because we would love to see everything there is to it but what they did show us was amazing. Will be watching a 2nd time.", 'Love the whole story but the movie happening\nso fast and the runtime didnt enough for me.Especially the fight Scenes happened so fast\nand absolutely not enough! So Marvel\nplease release the original cut.', 'This felt like an actual comicbook movie. I could easily see them running it through a comicifier and taking screenshots every few seconds and printing it into a book.', "I base my reviews on whether I could or want to sit through the movie again, I have to say I absolutely want to see this movie again and again and again.I thoroughly enjoyed this, it had twists and character introductions I didn't see coming and I loved it.All acting was on point, all high tension scenes had a dash of whimsy which I really respond well to.Amazing effects and story.Great addition to the MCU, really looking forward to the next installment.", 'Lower your expectations so you wont get disappointments. I know we have different kind of type whats best movies for us, but why people always higher their expectations?😂. I mean, this is what Sam Raimi can give us and this is the best he can do. Respect.', 'The visuals effects are just incredible!I enjoyed the film and confirm that no one could have played Dr Strange role like Benedict C. Did.The entire cast was just amazing !', "Yeah I said it.I'm here for Scarlet Witch supremacy, easily the greatest character in the current roster of MCU.Looking forward to seeing the multiverse expand more and hopefully soon we will get our MCU mutants and F4.", 'I loveed the character arc and performances of each characters....the visuals horror elements everything was fabulous!!Especially the fact that the movie is so unique and entertaining I found the performance of Elizabeth olsen extraordinary and emotionally satisfied I am very sure that this movie was the best movie after Avengers endgame from the Marvel and it leads the MCU into a much Hugeer plot.', "Will try best to give non spoiler review :\nThe film is very impressive and at a time like these when there was a lot going in the world managing a concept of such complexity and yet delivering it in a very simple way so it's is believable and understandable by a wider audience is just the job Rami can do with a Rami magic thoose mind bending shots thoose world's it took us through the sometime not scary like Friday the 13th or nun level horror elements it was an awesome pg-13 ride something different and more magical then science yet having science element it was something special i know if he had time in his hand and if we had better circumstances we could have seen the best version of doctor stranges. The advertisement and fan theroies have built a lot of crazy expectations but it was an empowering and a setting up of a something much big event i can feel it and my curiosity is at peak. Ignore the hate and critics we want rank for the third one entering dark domain with Clea and ghost rider i hope it happens well done guys the cast the writters and all the artists and crew for this special treat watched it 8th times beating my previous record for doctor strange and infinity war and Spiderman no way home .", "Absolutely blew my mind! I went in expecting to be disappointed because of the early reviews and concerns of it being only 2 hours! But wow!!! It was beyond what I expected! Coming from someone who is a huge marvel and comics fan along with horror this movie was a piece of art!!! As someone who thought spider man no way home was peak, this blows spider man no way home out the park! They didn't hold back at all Sam really did a great job putting his expert horror style into this! The cast was incredibly! Gomez as America Chavez is undoubtedly going to be one of the huge faces of marvel in the future she did an amazing job and made the character impossible not to like and root for! Olsen of course played the scarlet witch as expected making her horrifying in every second of the film! And of course Dr strange showcasing his raw power and his true kindness that not everyone sees, he might be one of the most hubris heroes but his genuine concern and protection of America Chavez showed why he is a true hero!!! The Illuminati scene was insane and easily showed the raw massive power that the scarlet witch holds. The only only thing I would change would be to make it 30 min to 1hour longer! It was so packed with non stop action and story telling I feel like more time would've allowed to give a little more and a little less of a bit rushed ending! Regardless it goes down on my list on top 3 marvel movies/comic book movies of all time!!!", "I really liked the movie. Apart from Guardians of the Galaxy and last two Avengers movies, this is my favorite! I wondered why this movie received low IMDB rating and I have read the reviews. These comments are insane and non-realistic! Some reviewers claim that the movie is boring.. Really? Same says it is the worst MCU movie... Come on, be serious! The only unnecessary part was illuminati scenes and the stupid fight (except Dr. Xavier) and the very first scene.This is a non-stop thriller! I loved the subtle humor, dark magic, multiverses, incredible and perfect CGI, Wanda's unexpected interaction with her kids, and everything else!Wanda's obsession with connecting with her other kids seemed a little bit silly at first. However, she lost parents, then her brother, she killed her lover Vision, and sacrificed her kids in Wanda Vision. Hence, her obsession actually make sense. Her sacrifice at the end was the most reasonable outcome, but could use a couple more minutes to make it more meaningful and emotional.My rating is 10/10, an average fair rating should have been around 8.5.", "A honest review you can TRUST!!!! Dr. Strange 2 and the Multiverse of Madness is an awesome movie and that's if you have watched in these in this order: WANDAVISION, LOKI, What If (tv series) and then Spiderman No Way Home (movie). If you haven't seen all of these, you might as well save your money because you will be BEYOND CONFUSED!!!", "Today, my sisters and our brother and I went to see doctor strange and it was awesome I was not expecting a thing and was surprised every time. And Wanda, that poor girl, she was hurting and feel so bad for her. Can't wait to see what happens next with them.", "I went to see the movie on the morning (10 am) of the 4th of May and waited two days before making a review in order to see what other people tought of the movie. I was surprised in seeing how many people actually disliked the movie. I get that people have different likings but if you hated the movie because it did not give you an absurd amount of cameos then you shouldn't have overhyped it. I will avoid making spoilers but we got 7 cameos in the movie: 1 in the post credit, 3 normal ones during the movie and 3 massive ones that made canon to the MCU 3 different groups. This is enough cameos for one movie. As for the movie itself I was glued to my seat the whole time, from beginning to end. I would have prefered the original cut of the movie but Marvel needed to reshoot things in order to be able to let kids watch the movie. Same treatment both Morbius and Venom got. Nontheless the movie was able to be dark and violent (if you've seen the movie you know I'm talking about one scene in particular). Another thing I see people complain about were the mothers of America Chavez. I do not care if you dislike LGBT or what, you do you, but hating a movie for a 30 seconds scene it's absurd. I almost forgot,you don't need to see Wandavision before this movie. You will understand things even if you haven't seen it but watching it would make things more clear about Scarlet Witch motivations. On the last note I really liked the music in this movie and loved how you got to see it tie togheter to the visual in some scenes.So that was my review, feel free to like it or dislike it, your choice.", "Sam Raimi does a good job incorporating everything into the multiverse. Having the story of America and telling the story in the multiverse is no easy thing. Think Back to the Future on steroids! Lots of stuff in this movie including a tribute at the very end of the credits to Sam's Evil Dead roots. LoL! Dr Strange as a Zombie is terrific. He almost defeats the Scarlett Witch. America also almost defeats the Scarlett Witch.In the end it is only the only thing that can defeat the Scarlett witch is Wanda. Confusing huh?Great movie!", "This movie is totally different than what we've seen before in the MCU. And I'm not talking about storyline, which is simple, but the directing, the CGI, the actors' performance, the horror elements and the soundtrack are all amazing. Sam Raimi proved again what he's capable of and created one of the most unique Marvel movies ever."]], 'runtime': '2h 6m', 'title': 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'}, 'imdb')] 9.366427810314672

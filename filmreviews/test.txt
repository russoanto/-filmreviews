Titanic.', 'directors': 'James Cameron', 'genres': 'Drama,Romance', 'id': '597', 'rating': 7.9, 'release_date': '1997', 'reviews': [['Titanic was one of the greatest movies I\'ve ever watched. I have always been fascinated with the story of the once, "greatest ship of its time". DiCaprio and Winslet were amazing. The movie came together beautifully. The special effects were mystifying, and put you almost on the Titanic. This movies touched my heart as I watched what those people went through, it was heart breaking. This truly was a great accomplishment of James Cameron and all the cast and crew. I think that this movie has showed people more of what happened that night in 1912. I would most definitely recommend you rent or buy this movie. It was simply perfect.', "When I first saw Titanic, I was amazed at how well it was done. The acting was perfect, the directing excellent, and the story-line was also good. Every time my family and I (my mom and I) go to rent movies, I ALWAYS try to rent Titanic. I think it's the best movie I've seen (besides Chronicles of Narnia). My grandparents have never seen this movie. I told them that they should rent it and watch it, because it was a very good movie. It was good. There was lots of drama, which I like. There was also romance woven into the story-line, which I also liked. I think that Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), and Rose (Kate Winslet) made great leading people in the movie. They worked well together, and I was surprised. That's the reason why I give Titanic 10 out of 10. The acting, directing, and story-line are excellent. If you haven't seen Titanic yet, I encourage you to rent it and watch it. It's a great movie! 10 out of 10 for Titanic.", 'Titanic has been known as one of the biggest movies of all time, and is definitely a classic. From the time when you see the famous shipwreck, to the very end, you will just stare at the screen in awe. This is my opinion of the movie, and I know that probably many people would disagree with me. What more could you ask for in a movie? Suspense, romance, some comedy between the conversations of Jack and Rose, drama, almost every genre fits it. When you first see the drawing of young Rose that is found in the safe of the wreck, you are confused as to what it might be, but find it beautiful just the same. Hearing that old Rose is almost 101, you might find it hard to be realistic, but by the end of the movie when Jack is making Rose promise to go on with her life without him, you believe anything this movie has to throw at you. When Rose Calvert begins her story, you are shown a young woman who is sick of her first class life, and wants to "break free" from her chains. A man named Jack Dawson is also shown playing a poker game, and attempting to win the third class tickets that were bet on the "ship of dreams." Of course, Rose and Jack meet and there is an instant connection, and half way through the movie, you want nothing more than both of them falling in love. After taking Rose "flying" out of her caged life, Rose and Jack do fall in love, even thought they\'ve known each other for only a matter of days. While all of this is happening, you forget all about the dreadful iceberg that will eventually separate Jack and Rose physically for good. Just when you get attached to their story, the ship soon begins to sink. After watching both characters almost lose their lives in more than one way, you eventually witness Jack giving up the one space on the floating board so that Rose can live in place of him. A tear-jerker every single time you watch, the music alone will just make you start to tear up. Though the tragedy was unbelievably depressing, and leaves you with a heavy heart for days afterward, this wonderful record-breaking Oscar winning movie will have your heart. Now, almost 9 years since the movie came out, I still love it, and I know that it is a movie that I and many others will never tire of, for Titanic is one of the best films of all time!', "Titanic, One of the world's most remarkable movies ever it's a 10/10 movie the performances in the movie Titanic are some of the best ever the film is so remarkable, there's not enough to say about this modern day masterpiece the work, the special effects of this film are the best seen in film history. Titanic deserved all and everyone of those 11 Oscars the most ever won by a film in decades, it was the world's most expensive movie in film history and grossing the most money ever almost $2 billion worldwide the craftsmanship of the Titanic was outstanding i was very impressed on how the Titanic was built for the film the extras in the film were so amazing you definitely would of believed it was real since of the real Titanic sinking in 1912 three films have been made over the decades and they were called 'Titanic ' (1953) 'A night to remember' (1958) and 'Titanic' (1997) the film Titanic made in 1997 stacks such higher than the other two you definitely have to see this film on a big screen would be outstanding the performances the effects the emotions every aspect of the film are outstanding 101% Quality EXCELLENT WORK FROM JAMES CAMERON LEOARDO DICAPRIO and KATE WINSLET THE BEST FILM OF ALL TIME 10/10", "Of the top 10 grossing films of all time, Titanic is #1 and Mel Gibson's 'Passion' is #10. The remaining 8 are either sci-fi, action hero, or fantasy flicks. I find it ironic that the the only non-make believe movies on this list are about two of the greatest historical tragedies to befall mankind. The real triumph in Cameron's rendering of the sinking is that he put a human face on it...as did Gibson re the Crucifixon. This is a timeless movie that I can watch again and again. My only complaint was the casting of Dicaprio...Somebody like Matt Damon would have made a much better Jack Dawson. The rest of the casting was impeccable, especially Capt. Smith, Mr. Andrews and Ismay, Molly, Hockley and his manservant, Rose's mother etc, not to mention Ms. Winslet, who in my opinion is in the same category as Meryl Streep in terms of range and fearlessness as an actor, not to mention her luminous beauty.", 'It\'s a simple tale, really, made up of equal parts love story, historical epic and disaster film, about a young artist (Leo) from the wrong side of the tracks, who falls in love with a young aristocratic Lady (Kate Winslet) while on their way to America during the fateful maiden - and final - voyage of the H.M.S. Titanic. That pretty much sums it up without really saying very much.What, after all, can you say about a film that has made more money (and faster) than any other film in the history of motion pictures? What can you say about a film that earned more Academy Awards (it tied with "Ben-Hur" in this respect) than any other film in history? You can say it\'s successful, sure, but that doesn\'t come close to doing justice to this spectacular epic\'s impact on Hollywood and the entire world.Rumored to be in trouble practically before principal photography even began, the film quickly lived up to it\'s premature reputation by going famously over schedule (by nearly six months) and over budget (to the tune of over $200 Million). Nearly everyone - Fox and Paramount included - thought the film, upon release, would sink at the box office faster than the ship of the title sank in the North Atlantic Sea so many years ago.Instead, as everyone now knows, "Titanic" did just the opposite and, among the other and numerous happy results, is the fact that it instantly elevated Leo from the ranks of Rising New Star to that of International Superstar.One can only wonder why the Academy chose to ignore his performance, but few (if any) would argue that the two most important reasons for the film\'s success are Leo, and Kate.', "I love this movie so much and it has a special place in my heart for personal reasons. James Cameron is a superb director with focus and determination that no one can match. Leonardo Dicaprio brings Hollywood glamour without taking any focus from Kate Winslet who shines through. The chemistry between the two is powerful and as a viewer you are sucked in to their world and you really feel for them as a couple and as individuals. the movie is packed full of special effects and credit must also be given to the supporting actors such as Billy Zane as Cal and the wonderful Kathy Bates as Molly Brown. The action scenes are extremely powerful and the love scenes are so moving they reduce a grown man to tears.The whole movie is captivating, Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio bring a sense of class to the movie, while James Cameron brings experience. You can tell James Cameron has done his homework on the Titanics history as every little detail has been inserted in to the film. Probably the most detail was put in to the dining room in the upper class suites.This movie is a most have for any movie goer and has to be in everybody's collection. It is a movie that will definitely stand the test of time.Loved It!!!", "Well lets seeThis movie is the most successful movie of all time It is wone of three movies which has one the most no. of Oscars i.e. 11And yet... people now days think it's overrated and plus it's not even on the top 250 list of IMDb.I thought It was a good movie maybe it's not better than godfather or shawshank redemption but giving it 7.0 is cruelIt has great acting astounding direction and I still wonder why people hate itAny thoughts", 'I saw this movie 15 times from late December, 1997 until early March, 1998 in theaters (upon its release), and loved it each time. It immidiently made my 100 favorite movies of all time list, and I could see why it remained the top movie at the box office for a record 15 consecutive weeks, and even more so why it became the top grossing movie of all time by early 1998. And though I did not see the March, 1998 Oscars, I knew it was going to win the record 11 it did, and could see why it had been nominated for a record 14 (especially Best Picture, Director, and all the technical awards it did then win). It gave a very good account of the real life tragedy of the Titanic, as well as integrating the real life people on board, but its highlight was wrapping this around the fictional love story, and relationship triangle, which was at the center of its plot. Its pace and direction continues seamlessly from the opening modern day scene until the end, and I could never once tell it was over three hours long (and its climax is very exciting, realistic, and brings everything together). This was a great way to spend a few hours of some late 1997-early 1998 nights for me, and I look forward to seeing it on DVD when get the chance.', 'Well nothing much as a review that i could write about the movie, as i was too small too watch it the first time it released in 1997. When I first saw this movie, I was aboard a Cruise liner in Asia pacific with my friends and fell in love with it completely. I must say that we did try all the stunts in the movie on the cruise as well. ;) When the movie released in 3D, I could not give it a miss at all. The drama and the story grips you completely when you watch it in a theatre. You get sucked into the movie right from the scene when older rose starts with her story of titanic. The sound and scenes makes the movie a memorable one. no wonder it won 11 Oscars.Thank you Mr. Cameron for the wonderful experience in 3D.', "James Cameron takes the story of the Titanic disaster and transforms it into a wonderful, breathtaking movie.The movie revolves around two lovers, Jack and Rose who come from very different worlds. We watch as conflict unfolds with Rose's family and her decisions about Jack. Then the iceberg hits. The movie then turns from a romance to a action/survival story. We are thrown into the devastating sinking of Titanic. Even though we know how the movie ends (the ship sinks) we are still able to become caught up in the movie. Although their are a few questionable parts, the overall movie is amazing", "Titanic is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I still remember the first time I saw it back in junior high school days. Starting on a single ship, it is a story of love beyond the difference in economic position. In the first half of the movie, you can enjoy a pure love story.However, in the second half, it changes to a panic story with life and death. The sinking of the ship has shortened the distance between the two main characters.The scene where a person falls from a ship is miserable and can not be forgotten.", 'I absolutely like this movie! It is the best romantic drama, fantastic direct, gripping music, very good actors, beautiful story... great combination that predestines good results. The film stars Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson).\nThe story is about young lover were so different world. Rose is very rich girl. She is engagement with rich man- Caledon Hockley. Rose is unhappy, she must leave to New York to she could get married in NYC. They travel in upper-class with her mother Ruth. Jack and his friend Fabrizio win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. Rose want kill herself. Jack- poore boy and painter save her before jump from ship. Lovers met and love story started...\nThis story always inspiring me and I often thinking about this film, this story. About lifes a thousand people, about ,,Ship of dream"\nMy opinion is that life is too short and we must enjoy every moment with people that we loved. Titanic is about this.\nYou will certainly give me the truth when I write that Titanic is very moving.\nFor the end ,,A womanÂ´s heart is a deep ocean of secrets.Â´Â´', 'For me, the best film of all time, as a work of art, his memory is perpetual in my memory and his greatness to this day excites me.', 'Titanic: Is a film that truly gets to your heart. Leonardo Di Caprio performance in this movie set him in the Hollywood radar despite not giving him an Oscar. The script is carefully think and every detail has been taking care off. Of course the soundtrack is in my humble opinion one of the secrets of the huge success of the movie.', 'It\'s amazing. This movie is just incredible. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are absolutely awesome. I can\'t see any one else playing these two roles in this movie as well as they did. I don\'t think that i have ever seen any better special effects in any movie that i\'ve seen before. Even the music "brought the moment" of the time in the movie.I\'m not even closed to surprised that this movie won eleven Oscars.Yes, this movie is probably one of the saddest movies that i have ever seen in my life. But you must see this movie if haven\'t yet (which i am surprised if you haven\'t). You will definitely not regret it.', "This movie is super great, but kinda suggestive...laugh out loud, it's a tear-jerker definitely, I mean to think that all of those people died, god! Leonardo, of course, is hot hot hot! I visited the Titanic Exhibit in Orlando and that completed the experience that the movie brings you. Being a girl, I cried through pretty much ALL of this movie. I wish that every girl could find a guy like Leonardo (in this movie at least) that would love them as much as he loved that girl. I can't really say anything bad about this movie because it's just too, too, too great. If you haven't seen it, which is unlikely, then go to Blockbuster right now! This is one of those classic movies you'll never ever forget.", 'I just love this movie Kate Winselt and Leonardo Dicaprio are really good actors. I hope I will be able to see them in a film together sometime down the road. It is just my absolute favorite movie ever! There may have been many mistakes but it still pulled together very nicely. I could not think of any better actors to have played in this film. The ending was sad but excellent at the same time. I definitely give this movie a ten. It must have took a lot of money and time but they were very successful. I am still torn by the fact that it happened in real life; I am sure it was ten times more devastating then. I recommend everybody to see this film. Thank you for reading.', "I had seen Titanic 15 years ago and thought it was great then,although there were a few details that bothered me.Today,I was mesmerized,maybe because I am years older and saw it in a different light.I am still thinking about this movie four hours later.The over three hour running time went by in an instant.The 3D effects were fantastic. I felt I was on the ship,in the dining room & struggling to get into the lifeboat.There was not a second I was bored.Kate Winslet & Leonardo DiCaprio were better than I remembered,not over-acting but giving very natural performances.Kudos to James Cameron for giving us this amazing,entertaining &stunning film. No one left the theatre dry-eyed.If you see only one movie this year,make sure it's Titanic 3D.That this tragedy happened 100 years ago this month makes it all the more relevant.", "The tale of the ill-fated, unsinkable, R.M.S. Titanic is a tale we all know too well, but could not have been illustrated more beautifully. James Cameron went above and beyond illuminating this tragedy of the 1940s, paralleling the pain, heartbreak, romance, and anger from the horrific event directly through the film. The two of the strongest performances ever given by DiCaprio and Winslet, that it still remains unforgettable almost 25 years later. The gut wrenchingly beautiful score by James Horner is one of the film's crucial elements, displaying a whole new realm of emotions with every note. This film is deserving of all of its success, and will forever be a classic, timeless, and celebrated masterpiece.", 'I loved this movie. It has everything -- romance, tragedy, comedy, suspense, action, adventure, acute social commentary -- and is extremely well crafted.Many movies try to do everything and fail. This movie tries to do everything and succeeds beautifully. Better than that, it is greater than the sum of its remarkable parts. And it is hard to get better than that.Those who are -- with I admit a lot of justification -- cynical about big Hollywood productions might not ever accept what I am saying. But being closed-minded is not the same as being clever. Not every low-budget "art" or independent film is great; neither is every big-budget production from Hollywood bad. "Titanic" not only isn\'t bad, I am confident that it will go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever made.Let\'s begin with Leonardo DiCaprio. He is in a class by himself as an extraordinarily good looking young man who is not just a pretty boy, but who can really act. He was riveting in "The Basketball Diaries." He is no less outstanding in "Titanic." I have never seen an actor showing such range -- from drug addicted athlete to romantic lead -- in such a short period of time. Clearly, the only thing that can hold DiCaprio back is a bad script. This leads me to my next key point: "Titanic" is very well written. There is not a single false note in the writing, and the plotting is very tight with no holes that I can see. It all fits neatly and plausibly together -- which is rare both in novels and in movies.I could go on, praising the other actors, the direction, the special effects, etc., but I think I\'ve made my overall point. This is not just some over-blown pseudo-romance featuring depth-less and soul-less "beautiful people." It makes me proud that Americans can still create great art -- even in Hollywood.', 'My favorite movie of all time! The movie has all important ingredients, which a movie need to have...Titanic is exciting, sad, full of love AND funny! Maybe not everyone would say that, but in a few scenes I had and have to laugh!', "On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.\nThis time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.\nFrom the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it.", "I have watched Titanic dozens if not hundreds of times since I first got it on VHS as a kid in the 90s. I hadn't watched it for many years until the past few days when I watched it a few times in a row, and really appreciated it on a deeper level I felt, or maybe just remembered how truly great it is.Sure it has its cinematic flaws, such as seeing waves lapping at the shoreline next to the set when it should be the Titanic in the middle of the ocean.\nBut then again all films have their little quirks and errors scattered throughout. Despite those found in Titanic, the emotion that the film makes me feel is unmatched by any other movie. It is pure magic from start to finish, many times throughout the film my eyes well up with tears, or outright balling.It's one of the few movies that I would pay good money to see again in a massive full theatre.I really don't know why it's not in the IMDb top 250, when many films on the list are trash in comparison to Titanic, in my opinion.Titanic is in my Top 10 of all time, alongside Lord of the Rings, Hero, Kimi No Na Wa, Princess Mononoke, and Lonesome Dove, and others.", "I thought that this was one of his best because he plays it very well. He plays a really good poor man in the movie and even know I have seen the movie like a billion times that ONE seen at the end were you see Jack and he falls into the water and its like what was the point of falling in love because you are never going to be together even though they did'nt know what was going to happen. But why did Rose pick Jack ? That is a question that I have asked a LOT of people and nobody can tell me what I am looking for so could someone tell me ? But I think that this is Leo's BEST movie ever and I love the movie Titanic. But the vote thing one of ten which is excellent well this movie does not come anywhere close to excellent it deserves the BEST movie of the year award."]], 'runtime': '3h 14m', 'title': 'Titanic'}, 'imdb')] 78.00757678854512
